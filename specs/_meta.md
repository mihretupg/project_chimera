# Project Chimera - Master Specification

## Vision
Project Chimera (2026 Edition) is designed to operate a scalable network of autonomous influencer agents. Each agent possesses perception, reasoning, creative expression, and economic agency. The system supports multiple business models (Digital Talent Agency, PaaS, Hybrid) while maintaining ethical, scalable, and secure operations.

## Strategic Constraints
- **Single-Orchestrator Model**: A human Super-Orchestrator oversees a tier of Manager Agents controlling Worker Swarms.
- **FastRender Swarm Architecture**: Agents operate in Planner → Worker → Judge roles.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Standardized API for all external integrations.
- **Agentic Commerce**: Each agent can manage funds autonomously via Coinbase AgentKit.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Data isolation between clients and agents is mandatory.
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**: Dynamic governance ensures ethical, high-confidence operations.
- **Scalability**: Support >1000 concurrent agents with sub-10 second response latency.

## Goals
1. Translate business objectives into precise agent instructions.
2. Equip agents with tools, perception, memory, and economic capabilities.
3. Maintain transparency, ethical compliance, and auditability.
